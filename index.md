## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2, part 1 
This was a fun lab because this was the first time actually doing a code for the first time that was challenging rather than the first lab. We learned how to use std::getline and how to call the string into our std::cout statement.

* Lab 5, part 2
This lab was very interesting to do because we had to declare double type variables and initialize them. Also trying to convert decimals/inches into feet was challenging. In the end I was able to figure out how to do it which was very rewarding for me.

* Lab 9 part 1
This lab was kind of frustrating to do because I was getting confused on what to do. But I asked the AP teacher for some help and she explained it to me and I finally understood what to do for this lab. I like how it challenged my skills and my mind and I had to use my notes from class lectures to figure out what to do. I liked how we used strings and vectors to read the contents of the words and store them into the dictionary.
